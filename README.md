# Automatic Context Inconsistency Repair

This repository provides a Python implementation for evaluating logical formulas within a given context.
It supports various logical operations, such as NOT, AND, OR, IMPLIES, and EQUALS, and allows for quantifiers like FOR ALL and EXISTS over context sets.
Future work aims to develop a comprehensive technique for automatically resolving context inconsistencies, dividing the process into two stages:
generating abstract repairs to meet integrity or correctness requirements based on user preferences and executing these repairs,
thereby reducing search space and improving efficiency.
